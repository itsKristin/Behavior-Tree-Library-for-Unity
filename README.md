# Behavior-Tree-Library-for-Unity
I worked out a little library for you to easily implement Behaviour Trees into your Unity Projects. Youâ€™ll find a Link to the GitHub Repository at the very end of this page. The Library is fully commented but I decided to post the documentation and explanation of Behaviour Trees here as it might be helpful for some people (You can thank me later!).
